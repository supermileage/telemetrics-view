View the page [here](http://www.supermileage.ca/telemetrics-view/). You'll have to log in with the UBCST Google account for verification.

Note that, at the moment, a Google Cloud instance needs to be spun up to run our Node script to connect Pub/Sub with Datastore. Otherwise data won't update.

### `npm run deploy`

With the latest changes, the GitHub pages website can be updated by running that command.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
